    "In this notebook, we will be exploring reinforcement learning. We will begin by hypothesising the usefulness of reinforcement learning (RL) for healthcare; an application area in which it is seldom used. We will then go into the depths of RL, including the underlying statistical methodology of Markov decision processes (MDPs), and various RL approaches and paradigms. Finally, we hope to apply this knowledge to some examples to suggest how RL could be used in healthcare, especially in the context of multimorbidity trajectory modelling. "

    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that has exploded in popularity in recent years, especially in areas with dynamic worlds such as real-time gaming and robotics. It is yet to gain popularity for use in healthcare, but there is some research emerging in this area, especially using offline RL. The primary goal of this project is to achieve a deep understanding of the methodology and mechanisms behind different types of RL (most of which are built on either a Q-learning or actor-critic based learning approach), as well as recent advances in deep RL. Through doing this, the goal is to then consider how RL can be used in the context of multimorbidity, by constructing an RL approach for modelling multimorbidity disease prediction over time ('multimorbidity trajectory modelling') using a multi-state model. Due to the methodological focus of this project, by studying the intricacies of different approaches in a thorough manner, the hope is that a deep understanding of RL will be gained. This will be useful in future research projects, whether that be applying RL to a specific healthcare problem, or even extending existing RL methodologies to advance the field. In summary, the objectives of this project (defined by C. Yau in https://github.com/cwcyau/hdruk-rl) are:\n",
    "- To develop a deep understanding of reinforcement learning, including the differences between varying approaches including Q-learning, actor-critic, and deep extensions.\n",
    "- To understand how to model multimorbidity trajectories using multi-state models.\n",
    "- To implement an RL approach to learn multi-state models for modelling multimorbidity trajectories. \n",

    "Markov decision processes (MDPs) form the basis of reinforcement learning problems. Let's focus on the main components of an MDP in the context of RL:\n",
    "- <b>Agent</b>: This is the active decision maker in the problem. This could be anything: a person, an animal, a game character, a self-driving car, etc. This <b>agent</b> interacts with its <b>environment</b>.\n",
    "- <b>Environment</b>: The environment is the 'world'; where exciting and scary things might happen, and the <b>agent</b> wants to be prepared to handle these and act accordingly. \n",
    "- <b>State</b>: The <b>state</b>, $S_t$, is the current situation. This is composed of the environment's status at each timestep $t$, as well as the agent's position within the environment. With each timestep, the agent makes a choice about what to do (performs an action) given its environment, and will transition to a new state.\n",
    "- <b>Action</b>: The action is the choice that the agent makes at each timestep, given its environment and current state. This leads an agent from one state to another. The agent wants to make a good choice, and so each action has a corresponding reward - or set of possible rewards in a non-deterministic world. \n",
    "- <b>Reward</b>: A reward is recieved at each timestep, after the agent transitions from one state $S_t$ to another, $S_t+1$. The rewards are cumulative, so the aim of the agent is to maximise the cumulative rewards over time, not just the individual reward at each timestep. It 'looks ahead' to estimate this, but more weight is given to rewards that are in the near future rather than far away by discounting estimated rewards far away - this is called the _discounted reward_, and the discount is always less than 1). Rewards can also be negative.\n",
    "- <b>Transition Probability</b>: This is the probability that at time $t$, from state $S_t$, the agent will transition to state $S_t+1$ given it performs action $a$. This is 1 if the actions are deterministic (i.e. each action has only one outcome state). \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll now give a 'fun' health-related example that vaguely mimics a simplified version of real-life to illustrate this. At each time _t_ we have:\n",
    "- Agent: a person\n",
    "- Environment: the earth/their life \n",
    "- State: the set of diseases/comorbidities the person has \n",
    "- Actions: lifestyle choices or medications that affect the likelihood of the agent developing or losing comorbidities\n",
    "- Reward: the reward of taking an action and ending in a different state. For example, the reward of smoking might be very negative since it will increase the likelihood of developing cancer or high blood presure, and the reward of exercise may be positive but small since it results in no change to comorbidities. A simple reward function can be determined as the number of comorbidities present in a given state, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ambition of the agent in this example is to battle diseases and remain as healthy as possible with minimal comorbidities, hence extending their lifespan; this will give the highest cumulative reward. "

    "It should help with clarity to formalise the definitions above in mathematical notation. In this way, an MDP can be defined as follows:\n",
    "- $S$ is the set of states, $A$ is the set of actions, $R$ is the set of rewards.\n",
    "- We have $n$ timesteps $t$, where $t = 0,1,2,...,n-1$.\n",
    "- The states at each $t$ is $S_t$, where $S_t \\in S$.\n",
    "- The current state at each $t$ is $s$, where $s \\in S_t \\in S$.\n",
    "- At each $t$, the agent $ag$ performs one action $a$, where $A_t$ is the set of possible actions, and $a \\in A_t \\in A$.\n",
    "- The action taken from a given state can be defined as a state-action pair $(s, a)$.\n",
    "- The $ag$ recieves a reward $r$ after taking action $a$ from state $s$. This happens with a given transition probability, and $ag$ moves to the next state, $s'$.\n",
    "- The transition probability from $(s, a)$ to $s'$ can be defined as $p(s')$, as it is simply the probability of ending up in that state. This also means that $p(r = p(s'))$, which is chosen from a selection of possible next states, $S_{t+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $s' \\in S_{t+1} \\in S$ and $r \\in R_{t+1} \\in R$. In a deterministic world, $s = S_{t}$ and $r = R_{t+1}$, as following each $(s, a)$ results in only one possible outcome state $s'$ with one possible corresponding reward $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each timestep, we reset the current state $s = s'$. The set of possible actions, $A_t$ is likely also updated.\n",

    "\n",
    "In steps:\n",
    "- The agent begins with no idea about what future actions and states might exist - it knows only its current environment. It therefore also has no idea how good any action and its corresponding rewards will be. Because of this, all of the Q-values for each state, action pair can be initialised to 0. These are updated using value iteration, as the agent moves through its environment, and stored in a Q-table, which is a grid of values, with one entry for each action, state pair (ignoring time). \n",
    "- The agent makes a choice of any action from its start state. It then lands in another state, and recieves a reward. The Q-value is updated for the first state, action pair. It then moves from this state, into another, by choosing another action, and recieves another reward. This will continue until the timesteps limit is reached (_max steps_, which can be configured), or the 'game' is ended for another reason (i.e. in the 'game of life', the individual dies). \n",
    "- The agent will start again, and complete the same process, updating the Q-values as it moves through the world. In later simulations of this (the number of 'games played' can also be configured), the agent can have a look in the table, and see what a good next action to take might be.  \n",
    "    - BUT the danger of this is that it'll just choose the same action over and over again, and not explore enough alternative options (i.e. get stuck in a local maxima by <b>exploiting</b> the environment). \n",
    "    - HOWEVER if it just keeps <b>exploring</b> forever, and ignores the Q-values found already, it will never converge. \n",
    "- So, in order to decide which paths to take, Q-learning utilises the <b>explore/exploit tradeoff</b> - which can be configured.\n"

Remember, exploring is randomly choosing an action, exploiting is choosing the action with the highest associated Q-value from the current state. However, when do we update this Q-value, if the state, action pair is revisited (e.g. at a later timestep) and the cumulative discounted reward therefore changes? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by using the <b>learning rate</b>, $Lr$: Between 0 and 1, this is basically how quickly an agent decides to update a Q-value for a given state, action pair. If set to 1, the old value will be completely replaced by the new value. 0 leaves the value as-is. Anything in between however, considers both the old and the new Q-values for that position - a higher $Lr$ results in more weight given to the new value. It is simply the weighted sum of the new _learned value_,  i.e. the cumulative discounted reward found for that state, action pair; and the old Q-value, following the calculation:\n",

    "Now that has hopefully made clear the basics of Q-learning and how a simple example might be implemented, we will shift focus to another key reinforcement learning paradigm: policy-gradient methods. These are appealing since rather than generating deterministic policy (like Q-learning does, using a value-based approach), they return stochastic policies, which are distributions over actions - this makes more sense for a lot of RL problems. However, there are issues with the basic policy-gradient approach, which we will explain - this has lead to the development of actor-critic learning techniques. We will go into these in detail, in a similar way as we did for Q-learning, to ensure understanding of this approach in the next notebook!"
